## Projects

This repository includes the following projects:

1. **Fractol**  
   A project where I created a fractal generator, implementing the famous Mandelbrot and Julia sets.
   
2. **Minitalk**  
   A mini project to implement a simple communication protocol between two processes using signals.

3. **Get Next Line (gnl)**  
   A project where I implemented the function `get_next_line`, which reads a line from a file descriptor.

4. **Libft**  
   A personal library containing useful functions that are commonly used in C programming.

5. **Push_swap**  
   A project where I implemented an efficient sorting algorithm for stacks, which sorts integers in the smallest number of operations.

6. **Printf**  
   A custom implementation of the `printf` function from the standard C library.

## How to Compile

To compile each project, make sure you have `Make` installed and run:

```bash
make
